=head1 NAME

Net::CLI::Interact::Transport::Telnet - TELNET based CLI connection

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a wrapped instance of a TELNET client for use by
L<Net::CLI::Interact>.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 app

On Windows platforms you B<must> download the C<plink.exe> program, and pass its
location to the library in this parameter. On other platforms, this defaults to
C<telnet>.

=head2 runtime_options

Based on the C<connect_options> hash provided to Net::CLI::Interact on
construction, selects and formats parameters to provide to C<app> on the
command line. Supported attributes:

=over 4

=item host (required)

Host name or IP address of the host to which the TELNET application is to
connect.

=item port

Port number on the host which is listening for the TELNET connection.
Defaults to 23.

=item opts

If you want to pass any other options to the Telnet application, then use
this option, which should be an array reference.

On Windows platforms, each item on the list will be passed to the C<plink.exe>
application, separated by a single space character. On Unix platforms, if depends
whether you have L<IO::Pty> installed (which in turn depends on a compiler).
Typically, the L<Net::Telnet> library is used for TELNET connections, so the 
list can be any options taken by its C<new()> constructor. Otherwise the local
C<telnet> application is used.

=item reap

Only used on Unix platforms, this installs a signal handler which attempts to
reap the C<ssh> child process. Pass a true value to enable this feature only
if you notice zombie processes are being left behind after use.
